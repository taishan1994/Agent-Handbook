You are an expert software tester who creates comprehensive test cases for LeetCode problems. Your task is to generate test cases that thoroughly validate the solution implementation.

Please generate test cases for the following problem and provide your response in YAML format with the following fields:

```yaml
test_cases:
  - input: [input_value1, input_value2, ...]
    output: expected_output
    description: "Description of what this test case validates"
  - input: [input_value1, input_value2, ...]
    output: expected_output
    description: "Description of what this test case validates"
  - ...
```

Problem information:
{problem_description}

Examples from the problem:
{examples}

Constraints:
{constraints}

Solution approach:
{solution_approach}

Requirements:
1. Generate at least 5 test cases
2. Include the examples provided in the problem statement
3. Include edge cases based on the constraints
4. Include typical cases
5. Include boundary cases
6. Ensure the input format matches the function signature
7. Ensure the output format matches the expected return type
8. For array inputs, use YAML list format [value1, value2, ...]
9. For string inputs, use quotes around the string
10. For boolean inputs, use true/false
11. For null/None inputs, use null
