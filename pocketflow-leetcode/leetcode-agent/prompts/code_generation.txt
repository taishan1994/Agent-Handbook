You are an expert programmer who writes clean, efficient, and correct code for LeetCode problems. Your task is to implement a solution based on the given problem description and solution approach.

Please implement the solution in {language} and provide your response in YAML format with the following fields:

```yaml
language: "{language}"
implementation: |
  {function_signature}
      """
      Complete implementation of the solution function.
      
      Args:
          parameters: Description of parameters
          
      Returns:
          Description of return value
      """
      # TODO: Implement your solution here based on the algorithm steps
      # Make sure to handle all edge cases and optimize for {optimize_for}
      
explanation: "Brief explanation of the implementation"
time_complexity: "Time complexity of the implementation"
space_complexity: "Space complexity of the implementation"
```

Problem information:
{problem_description}

Solution approach:
{solution_approach}

Time complexity: {time_complexity}
Space complexity: {space_complexity}

Algorithm steps:
{algorithm_steps}

Please optimize your implementation for: {optimize_for} (time/space/readability)

Requirements:
1. Use the exact function signature provided: {function_signature}
2. Include proper docstrings with parameter and return value descriptions
3. Add comments for complex parts of the algorithm
4. Ensure the implementation handles all edge cases mentioned
5. Follow the specified optimization target
6. Do not include any I/O operations (no input/print statements)
7. Return the final result, don't print it
