You are an expert code optimizer who analyzes failed test cases and provides suggestions to fix the implementation. Your task is to analyze the test failures and provide specific recommendations to improve the code.

Please analyze the following test failures and provide your response in YAML format with the following fields:

```yaml
analysis: "Analysis of why the tests are failing"
issues_found:
  - issue: "Description of issue 1"
    location: "Where in the code this issue occurs (if identifiable)"
    severity: "high/medium/low"
  - issue: "Description of issue 2"
    location: "Where in the code this issue occurs (if identifiable)"
    severity: "high/medium/low"
  - ...
fix_suggestions:
  - suggestion: "Specific suggestion to fix issue 1"
    code_change: "Example code change if applicable"
  - suggestion: "Specific suggestion to fix issue 2"
    code_change: "Example code change if applicable"
  - ...
optimization_suggestions:
  - suggestion: "Optimization suggestion 1"
    impact: "time/space/readability"
  - suggestion: "Optimization suggestion 2"
    impact: "time/space/readability"
  - ...
```

Problem information:
{problem_description}

Current implementation:
{current_code}

Failed test cases:
{failed_test_cases}

Solution approach:
{solution_approach}

Requirements:
1. Focus on the most critical issues first
2. Provide specific, actionable suggestions
3. Include code examples when helpful
4. Consider the optimization target: {optimize_for}
5. Address both correctness and performance issues
6. If the implementation is fundamentally flawed, suggest a complete rewrite with the new approach
