PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Please analyze this LeetCode problem URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

SOLUTION APPROACH:
Analyze the problem requirements and constraints to develop an optimized solution for time.

ALGORITHM STEPS:
1. Analyze the problem requirements
2. Design an algorithm based on the constraints
3. Implement the solution
4. Test with various test cases

COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
Time Complexity: To be determined after implementation
Space Complexity: To be determined after implementation

EDGE CASES:
- Handle empty input cases
- Consider boundary conditions

CODE IMPLEMENTATION:
```python
# Implementation for Custom Problem

def solution():
    # TODO: Implement the solution
    pass
```

CODE EXPLANATION:
Basic implementation for Custom Problem.

TEST RESULTS:
Total Tests: 1
Passed: 0
Failed: 1
All Passed: False

FAILED TEST CASES:
Test 1: Basic test case
  Input: Sample input
  Expected: Expected output
  Actual: Error: CodeExecutor.execute_python_code() got an unexpected keyword argument 'test_input'

FEEDBACK ANALYSIS:
Analysis of the failed test cases. Error: Failed to parse structured response: while scanning for the next token
found character '`' that cannot start any token
  in "<unicode string>", line 1, column 1:

    ^
Response text: ```yaml
analysis: "The current implementation is completely empty and does not contain any logic to solve the Two Sum problem. The error message 'unexpected keyword argument 'test_input'' indicates that the test executor is passing input parameters that the function is not accepting. This suggests a fundamental issue with the function signature and implementation. The function must accept an array of integers and a target value, then return the indices of two numbers that add up to the target. The current code does not handle input parameters at all, nor does it implement any algorithm to find the two numbers."

issues_found:
  - issue: "Function does not accept required input parameters (nums and target)"
    location: "def solution():"
    severity: "high"
  - issue: "No algorithm implemented to solve the Two Sum problem"
    location: "def solution():"
    severity: "high"
  - issue: "Function does not return the expected result format (list of two indices)"
    location: "def solution():"
    severity: "high"

fix_suggestions:
  - suggestion: "Modify the function to accept two parameters: nums (list of integers) and target (integer)"
    code_change: "def two_sum(nums, target):"
  - suggestion: "Implement a hash map (dictionary) approach to achieve O(n) time complexity"
    code_change: "def two_sum(nums, target):\n    num_map = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in num_map:\n            return [num_map[complement], i]\n        num_map[num] = i\n    return []"
  - suggestion: "Ensure the function returns a list containing the two indices that sum to the target"
    code_change: "return [num_map[complement], i]  # Returns the indices in ascending order"

optimization_suggestions:
  - suggestion: "Use a hash map (dictionary) for O(1) average lookup time, reducing overall time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)"
    impact: "time"
  - suggestion: "Initialize the hash map outside the loop and populate it incrementally during iteration to avoid redundant lookups"
    impact: "time"
  - suggestion: "Use enumerate() to get both index and value in a single iteration, improving code readability and reducing overhead"
    impact: "readability"
```

ISSUES FOUND:
- Code implementation does not pass all test cases

FIX SUGGESTIONS:
- Review the failed test cases and adjust the implementation
